	<p1>In the 1987 Cricket World Cup, the Indian cricket team had a mixed performance, reaching the semi-finals but failing to make it to the final stage.

        Key Points:
        
        Performance:
        
        India was captained by Kapil Dev, the iconic all-rounder who had led the team to a historic World Cup win in 1983.
        The team's performance in the group stage was reasonably solid, securing victories against Australia, Zimbabwe, and a notable win against New Zealand.
        In the knockout stage, India faced England in the semi-final held in Mumbai. Unfortunately, they fell short and were defeated by England, missing out on the opportunity to compete in the final.
        Contributions:
        
        Throughout the tournament, several players made significant contributions. Kapil Dev led from the front, showcasing his all-round abilities with both bat and ball.
        Batsmen like Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, and Mohammad Azharuddin played crucial roles with their batting performances.
        Ravi Shastri, known for his all-round abilities, was also a key player for the Indian team during the tournament.
        Legacy:
        
        Despite not making it to the final, the 1987 World Cup showcased India's talent and potential on the global cricketing stage. It was a stepping stone for the team, setting the groundwork for future successes.
        The tournament highlighted the emergence of several young talents in the Indian cricketing landscape, who would go on to become stalwarts of the team in the following years.
        Though the Indian team didn't clinch the trophy in the 1987 World Cup, their journey showcased promising performances and talent, indicating a positive future for Indian cricket on the world stage.</p1>
