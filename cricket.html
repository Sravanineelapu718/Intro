        Key Points:
        
        Performance:
        
        India was captained by Kapil Dev, the iconic all-rounder who had led the team to a historic World Cup win in 1983.

        Throughout the tournament, several players made significant contributions. Kapil Dev led from the front, showcasing his all-round abilities with both bat and ball.
        Batsmen like Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, and Mohammad Azharuddin played crucial roles with their batting performances.
        Ravi Shastri, known for his all-round abilities, was also a key player for the Indian team during the tournament.
