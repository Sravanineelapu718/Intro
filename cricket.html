        <p1>In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, India’s journey was a blend of highs and a significant controversy:

                Under Mohammad Azharuddin's captaincy, India began with promise, securing wins against Kenya and the West Indies. Sachin Tendulkar, in scintillating form, displayed his exceptional batting prowess early on, setting the tournament alight with his performances.
                        
                 Despite some successes, India faced a notable setback against Australia. However, they quickly recovered, triumphing over Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Tendulkar’s consistency and brilliance with the bat were the standout highlights, making him the tournament's leading run-scorer and captivating audiences worldwide with his masterful strokeplay.
                        
                However, the tournament took a controversial turn during the semi-final clash against Sri Lanka at Kolkata's Eden Gardens. In a highly charged atmosphere, India's batting collapsed under pressure while chasing Sri Lanka's target. Frustrated by the team's performance, the crowd turned unruly, disrupting play. The match ended in chaos, with umpires awarding the game to Sri Lanka due to the crowd interference, leaving a bitter taste and disappointment among Indian fans.
                        
                Despite the controversial end, the tournament showcased Tendulkar's brilliance and highlighted the need for crowd discipline and sportsmanship in cricket. While the incident remains a significant footnote, Tendulkar's extraordinary performances were a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing campaign for India.
