    <p1>Winning all nine matches in the league stage is an incredible feat. India were the only undefeated team until the final and that deserves a lot of appreciation. Other than that, there are multiple moments that will forever be edged into the hearts of cricket lovers. Virat scoring his 50th ODI century at Wankhede Stadium and bowing down to Sachin Tendulkar was an iconic celebration that cannot be recreated. 
    The medal ceremony is another thing that the fans used to wait for after any India game. All the cricketers used to gather in the dressing room as fielding coach T Dilip used to announce the winner in a unique manner, which the stakeholders of the team absolutely fell in love with. Another thing that they fell in love with was Rohit Sharmaâ€™s selfless approach. He took the matter into his own hands and delivered time and again for the team, even when he was nearing a milestone. In a country where milestones are worshipped, Rohit showed that people also love the intent and approach.</p1>
